/**
 * This class provides convenience, front-end functions for ImgPlus transfer.
 *
 * There are actually two main sorts of the functions. The first sort
 * consists solely of static functions, which thus cannot remember any state
 * of the transfer after they end. These functions, therefore, allow to
 * send/receive only one image.
 *
 * The second sort of functions are not static functions. Caller must create
 * an object/instance of this class in order to use them. In this way,
 * multiple images can be sent/received one by one, always single image with
 * single function call. This necessitates that the looping over images to be
 * transferred has to happen on the caller's side, but it is not a difficult
 * piece of code and brings additional flexibility for the caller to decide
 * when he is ready for the transfer (e.g., allowing for streamlining of the
 * processing of the transferred images).
 *
 * In order to transfer multiple images, just call the transfer function
 * repeatedly (every time with different image, of course). The first call
 * would open the connection and transfer the first image, consequent calls
 * would just transfer their images. REMEMBER, however, to call the hangUpAndClose()
 * after last image was transferred! Receiving party should call
 * isThereNextImage() to determine if it should receive one more image or
 * hangUpAndClose() now. Note that the image transferring protocol knows, after every
 * image is transferred, whether there shall be next transfer.
 *
 * When sending images, you can optionally advice/send hint to the receiving
 * party about the number of images you plan to send. This can be achieved by
 * providing the constructor with the particular positive number. When receiving
 * images, you can optionally read the hint with getExpectedNumberOfImages()
 * anytime after the first image has arrived.
 *
 * Their might come, if requested, a third sort that would be collecting
 * convenience functions to send/receive an array of images.
